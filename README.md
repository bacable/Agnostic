Class Scaffolding Framework

### Road Map ###

Working on features for Major Iteration 2

####Major Iteration 1####

 1. This is where I was at when I made the first commits to Git.
 2. Basically a proof of concept, took in a json structure and a json template and processed the structure through the template in order to convert it to basic scaffolding code that resembles actual programming code, and doesn't require too much extra work in order to compile. Only had basic templates for C#, Objective-C, and Python

####Major Iteration 2####

 1. Write templates for top 10 languages on Tiobe (perhaps more if motivated to)
 2. Add support for header files to allow for C++ and Obj-C templates
 3. Output to files, with separate files for each class or structure
 4. Get type mapping working, so you can show the proper type text for primitives and objects, and allow for variable initialization
 5. Add constructor key to templates, and build constructor function
 6. Add support for passing in arguments to pass in the language file and the location of the structure json file to use
